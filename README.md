# Predictions-with-Kmeans

The objective(s) are as mentioned below: 

We have been provided with a dataset which contains answers about a survey conducted among the students of a certain University. This survey deals with the eating habits of the students about what they prefer to eat and their food choices. The dataset contains information about the GPA, Gender, sport activities, exercise regime as well as food choices such as Veggie intake, chicken calories consumed, fries as well as other food stuffs. It also contains details about which type of cuisines - greek, italian, Indian - the students prefer.

The University is holding an all you can eat buffet. For this the university wants to invite all the students. To ensure maximum students visit the buffet, the university is planning on launching a coupon campaign. The university wants to provide specific coupons to attract certain type of individuals to the buffet.

For this the university wants to recognise which kind of food the students prefer. The university wants to make sure maximum students attend, hence they want to provide personalized coupons which cater to the individuals' taste. For this the university wants us to draw a list based on what kind of coupons to provide to certain individuals. 

We will create a dendogram using the appropriate libraries and then run k means clustering on that to find what kind of coupons to provide to individuals.

PS: This is my own original work and no other similar projects have been found.
